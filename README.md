# pygame-raycasting
an old project of mine in python, finished around autumn 2018
i forgot to upload it to github, almost lost it couple of times

this project was one of my first experiences with python and programming overall

there's a bit of trigonometry used here; python trig functions aren't quite known for speed, so performance problems are present
only dependency is pygame and this thing can be run with 'py main.py'
